# Machine-Learning-For-Audio-Labs
This repository contains our code for the 4 labs of the course of **Machine Learning for Audio Application** @ Politecnico di Milano. The course covers the fundamentals of Machine Learning ad Deep Learning with particular focus on Audio applications. 

The course was split into 4 parts. At the end of each one we had a mandatory lab, which consisted in writing a Jupyter notebook in Python, the full syllabus is the following:

**Part I: Introduction** <br>
  • Course structure <br>
  • Goals of this course <br>
  • Overview of signal processing and machine learning in audio and acoustic engineering <br>
  • A detailed example: sound recognition <br>
  • A bit of history <br>
  • Challenges in ML for audio <br>
  • Applications  <br>
  • Development process of smart audio system <br>
  
**Part II: Audio Analysis and Pre-processing** <br>
  • Data acquisition and annotation. <br>
  • Time-frequency transforms: STFT, Perceptual Representations, Constant-Q transforms <br>
  • Feature engineering: <br>
  • Time-domain features, spectral features, MFCCs, periodicity <br>
  • Feature learning: Feature learning vs feature engineering, NMF <br>
  • Dimensionality reduction: PCA, feature selection <br>

**Part III: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods** <br>
  • Supervised and unsupervised learning <br>
  • The learning process, generalization <br>
  • Discriminative models <br>
  • Linear models (SVMs, Logistic Regression) <br>
  • Multiclass models <br>
  • Non-linear models (Kernel methods, k-NN, Decision Trees) <br>
  • Generative models <br>
  • Bayesian, ML, MAP, GMMs, HMMs <br>
  • Deep models <br>
  • MLP, 1D CNNs, 2D CNNs, RNNs, Hybrid models <br>
 
**Part IV: Performance Analysis** <br>
  • Datasets: Annotation, data-collection considerations <br>
  • Data augmentation: Time stretching, pitch shifting, noise addition <br>
  • Evaluation: Cross-validation, performance metrics <br>
